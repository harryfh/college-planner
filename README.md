A College Planner spreadsheet made with pure google sheets

### Why...

I've been teaching myself Google Sheets since I was in high school. I've used Sheets to create planners, to-do lists, checklists... basically everything in my life gets a spreadsheet for it. 
The one I got the most invested in was my spreadsheet that I use for keeping myself on track at school

## The Sheets

### Setup 
This is why I've been putting off sharing the spreadsheet. I've been working on it for so long, only for me, that it's incredibly hard to explain. I made a nice setup page to explain how it works! 
Now that it's not a chore to understand, check it out!
